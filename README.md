# Semantic Web

This project is intended for exemption from exam in **Semantic Web** university classes which involves designing and creating an OWL ontology that describes a given domain. The ontology does not have to cover the entire domain.

The simple implementation should utilze the [Apache Jena](https://jena.apache.org/index.html) Java Semantic Web Frameworkd 

## Chosen Domain

The chosen domain is related to  **Project Management**‍💼 and is chosen from “*Software Engineering (10th Edition)*” by Ian Sommerville.

## Docs

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies. **Here you should put the Jena `*.jar` library files** ⚠

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
